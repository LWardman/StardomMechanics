The files containing my personal verse code are the ones located in the root folder that end in .verse (Or any that don't say Initial Commit).

These files intend to show competence at...
- Creating UI
- Manipulating existing devices
- Binding and recieving events
- Linear Algebra
- The in's and out's of Verse

All other files are products of EpicGames.
